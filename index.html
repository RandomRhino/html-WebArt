    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>We have feared the unknown throughout our existence, and have thus attempted to graze it with our fingertips, through art; the most mystical form of human expression.</p>

       <p>The Rhino begins this journey of human expression. Of love, hate, joy, anguish, lust, pain, anger, yearning, first and foremost, through music. 
        This will later be expanded to the visual and written arts, with the ultimate goal being the exploration of an immersive technological human art-form.</p>
        
        <p>The Rhino will begin as one faceless being, and will touch both the intimately personal, and the intimately universal.</p>
        
        <p>Then, you will join.
            Before our extinction</p>
